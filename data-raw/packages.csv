dplyr,data manipulation,TRUE,TRUE,https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dplyr,https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr,https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/,TRUE,,"A fast, consistent tool for working with data frame like objects, both in memory and out of memory."
janitor,data cleaning,TRUE,FALSE,https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=janitor,https://github.com/sfirke/janitor,http://sfirke.github.io/janitor/,TRUE,,"The main janitor functions can: perfectly format data.frame column names; provide quick counts of variable combinations (i.e., frequency tables and crosstabs); and isolate duplicate records. Other janitor functions nicely format the tabulation results. These tabulate-and-report functions approximate popular features of SPSS and Microsoft Excel. This package follows the principles of the ""tidyverse"" and works well with the pipe function %>%. janitor was built with beginning-to-intermediate R users in mind and is optimized for user-friendliness. Advanced R users can already do everything covered here, but with janitor they can do it faster and save their thinking for the fun stuff."
gt,tables,TRUE,TRUE,,https://github.com/rstudio/gt,https://gt.rstudio.com/,TRUE,In development.,"Build display tables from tabular data using with an easy-to-use API. With its progressive approach, we can construct display tables with a clear separation of concerns: you don't have to decide how the tabular data gets transformed and structured whilst also worrying about aesthetics."
yardstick,"modeling, roc, fit, confusion",TRUE,TRUE,https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=yardstick,https://github.com/tidymodels/yardstick,https://tidymodels.github.io/yardstick/,TRUE,,"Tidy tools for quantifying how well model fits to a data set such as confusion matrices, class probability curve summaries, and regression metrics (e.g., RMSE)."
rtweet,"twitter, tweet",TRUE,FALSE,https://cran.r-project.org/package=rtweet,https://github.com/mkearney/rtweet,https://rtweet.info/,TRUE,,An implementation of calls designed to collect and organize Twitter data via Twitter's REST and stream Application Program Interfaces (API).
broom,"modeling, fit",TRUE,TRUE,https://cran.r-project.org/package=broom,https://github.com/tidymodels/broom,https://broom.tidyverse.org/,TRUE,,"Summarizes key information about statistical objects in tidy tibbles. This makes it easy to report results, create plots and consistently work with large numbers of models at once. Broom provides three verbs that each provide different types of information about a model. tidy() summarizes information about model components such as coefficients of a regression. glance() reports information about an entire model, such as goodness of fit measures like AIC and BIC. augment() adds information about individual observations to a dataset, such as fitted values or influence measures."
tweetR,"twitter, tweet",,,,,,FALSE,Deprecated in favour of rtweet.,
tsibble,time series,TRUE,FALSE,https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tsibble,https://github.com/tidyverts/tsibble,https://tsibble.tidyverts.org/,TRUE,,"Provides a 'tbl_ts' class (the 'tsibble') to store and manage temporal data in a data-centric format, which is built on top of the 'tibble'. The 'tsibble' aims at easily manipulating and analysing temporal data, including counting and filling in time gaps, aggregate over calendar periods, performing rolling window calculations, and etc."
tibbletime,time series,,FALSE,,,,FALSE,Deprecated in favour of tsibble.,
caret,"classification, regression, modeling",FALSE,,https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=caret,https://github.com/topepo/caret,,TRUE,,Misc functions for training and plotting classification and regression models.
parsnip,"classification, regression, modeling",TRUE,TRUE,,https://github.com/tidymodels/parsnip,https://tidymodels.github.io/parsnip/,TRUE,,"A common interface is provided to allow users to specify a model without having to remember the different argument names across different functions or computational engines (e.g. 'R', 'Spark', 'Stan', etc)."
